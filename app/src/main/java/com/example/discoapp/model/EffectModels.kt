/**
 * Data class representing the configuration for a disco lighting effect. Each effect defines a
 * palette of colors, a duration for how long each color should be displayed, and flags to
 * optionally enable smooth fading transitions and strobe flashes.
 *
 * @property name A human readable name for the effect.
 * @property colors An array of ARGB colors to cycle through. Colors are expressed as
 *                  `Int`s rather than resource IDs so they can be created programmatically.
 * @property duration The duration in milliseconds that each color is shown. When fading is
 *                    enabled this value also controls the length of the crossâ€‘fade.
 * @property fade When true, transitions between colors are animated using an [android.animation.ArgbEvaluator].
 * @property strobe When true, black frames are inserted between colors to create a strobing effect.
